This is an example of what I expect for a call trace.

This is for the function factorial - defined as:
Formula: f(n) = n * f(n-1)
Base cases:
  - When n == 1, return 1
  - When n == 0, return 1


1. factorial(4)

f(4) =
4 * (f(3)) =
4 * (3 * f(2)) =
4 * (3 * (2 * f(1))) =
4 * (3 * (2 * 1)) =
4 * (3 * 2) =
4 * 6 =
